You will also create field enablement materials for the broader SA population, to help them understand how to integrate AWS solutions into customer architectures.

Candidates have a mix of communication and technical skills, and will have the ability to engage with customers at different levels in the organization, from executive to developer.

You will get the opportunity to work directly with senior engineers at customers, partners and AWS service teams, influencing their roadmaps and driving innovation.

If you are someone who enjoys innovating, likes solving hard problems and working on the cutting edge of technology, we would love to have you on the team.

You will also create field enablement materials for the broader SA population, to help them understand how to integrate AWS solutions into customer architectures.

Candidates have a mix of communication and technical skills, and will have the ability to engage with customers at different levels in the organization, from executive to developer.

You will get the opportunity to work directly with senior engineers at customers, partners and AWS service teams, influencing their roadmaps and driving innovation.

If you are someone who enjoys innovating, likes solving hard problems and working on the cutting edge of technology, we would love to have you on the team.

You will also create field enablement materials for the broader SA population, to help them understand how to integrate AWS solutions into customer architectures.

Candidates have a mix of communication and technical skills, and will have the ability to engage with customers at different levels in the organization, from executive to developer.

You will get the opportunity to work directly with senior engineers at customers, partners and AWS service teams, influencing their roadmaps and driving innovation.

If you are someone who enjoys innovating, likes solving hard problems and working on the cutting edge of technology, we would love to have you on the team.

You will also create field enablement materials for the broader SA population, to help them understand how to integrate AWS solutions into customer architectures.

Candidates have a mix of communication and technical skills, and will have the ability to engage with customers at different levels in the organization, from executive to developer.

You will get the opportunity to work directly with senior engineers at customers, partners and AWS service teams, influencing their roadmaps and driving innovation.

If you are someone who enjoys innovating, likes solving hard problems and working on the cutting edge of technology, we would love to have you on the team.

Description

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is looking for Big Data and Analytics Solutions Architects for our EMEA customers. If you have experience in designing architecture of data and analytics platforms, leveraging tools such as Apache Hadoop, Spark, Elasticsearch, or real-time event processing platforms such as Apache Storm or Kafka, and are interested in helping customers embrace cloud technologies, come and talk to us. Specialist Solutions Architects work with AWS' partners and customers to accelerate their cloud transformation. They engage in a wide range of activities around their domain of expertise, providing technical advice to customers, helping the internal and external communities, presenting AWS publicly on their domain, and providing a preferred path between AWS service teams and customers.

This is an opportunity to join Amazon’s technical teams, working with our engineers on the new services that power the cloud ecosystem, while developing your skills and furthering your career within what we believe to be one of the most innovative and progressive technology companies. These engagements will focus on Real Time and Batch-based Big Data processing, Business Intelligence, and Machine Learning. This role will specifically focus on AWS Services for Analytics, and on helping our customers and partners build innovative Solutions and Businesses that focus on leveraging the value of data.

As a Big Data and Analytics Specialist Solutions Architect (SA), you will help customers select the technologies that will support their business requirements. Part of the Specialist Solutions Architecture team, you will work closely with the other Specialist SAs on Big Data, Databases, Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, or Security, as well as the Business Development teams, to enable large-scale customer use cases and drive the adoption of AWS for their data processing platforms. You will interact with other SAs, providing guidance on their customer engagements by developing white papers, blogs, reference implementations, and presentations to enable customers and 3rd parties to fully leverage the AWS platform. You will also create field enablement materials for the broader SA population, to help them understand how to integrate AWS solutions into customer architectures.

Candidates have a mix of communication and technical skills, and will have the ability to engage with customers at different levels in the organization, from executive to developer. Previous experience with AWS is desired but not required, provided you have experience building large scale solutions. You will get the opportunity to work directly with senior engineers at customers, partners and AWS service teams, influencing their roadmaps and driving innovation.

If you are someone who enjoys innovating, likes solving hard problems and working on the cutting edge of technology, we would love to have you on the team.
